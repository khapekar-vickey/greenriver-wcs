                            Examples of acceptable management training include drinking water regulatory compliance, capacity development, rate setting, financial viability, water system security and responding to drinking water emergencies.

                            Training that may not meet the relevancy criteria is evaluated by the DOH Relevancy Review Committee.

                          To request a course evaluation and Continuing Education Unit (CEU) assignment for a conference or training scheduled in Washington or done virtually, the training sponsor must submit a completed evaluation request form with the required attachments listed on the form to Washington Certification Services. 
                          <br><br>
                          If the training meets the evaluation criteria established by Department of Health (DOH), the sponsor is notified in writing.  Courses evaluated and assigned CEU are issued an identification number.  The course sponsor must refer to this identification number on all correspondence or inquiries regarding the CEU assignment, and on the certificate of completion issued to training participants.
                          <br><br>
                          If your request for CEU evaluation and assignment is not approved you will receive a letter explaining the reason.  Appeals must be filed according to the Relevancy Review and Appeal Procedure – DOH.
                          <br><br>
                          CEU assignments for courses evaluated by Washington Certification Services are valid for three (3) years from the date of the original assignment.  The original assignment is considered invalid during the three-year period if the course sponsor, title, content, or length changes, or if the course no longer meets current DOH evaluation criteria.  Sponsors are notified at the end of the valid period and are required to submit a new evaluation request.
