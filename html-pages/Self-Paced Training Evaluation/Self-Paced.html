                  The Department of Health (DOH), Office of Drinking Water, has special guidelines for the evaluation and accreditation of Self-Paced Training (formally known as Distance Education) used by waterworks operators to meet the education requirement for certification examination or the professional growth requirement for certification renewal.

                  <br><br>
                  The following training formats are considered Self-Paced Training and must be evaluated and approved in advance based on the Department’s criteria:
                  
                  
                  <br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Online/Internet</li>
                    <li>CD-ROM</li>
                    <li>Correspondence Course</li>
                    <li>Video</li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  Please note that Self-Paced Training tends to be independant and unmonitored learning. <a href="#">Live Remote Virtual training</a> differs from Self-Paced Training in that it live training monitored by the course sponsor.

                         <p>In 2001 the Association of Boards of Certification (ABC), in cooperation with the American Waterworks Association (AWWA) and the Water Environment Federation (WEF), began a project to research industry standards for development and accreditation of Self-Paced Training.  This collaborative effort, combined with input from state certification programs, led to the development of a national guidance model.  The Department of Health (DOH) has incorporated its Waterworks operator professional growth criteria into the national guidance model approved by ABC.
                          <br><br>
                          Guidance for the Evaluation and Accreditation of Self-Paced Training lists the major elements that must be demonstrated in Self-Paced Training course design, development and sponsorship.  Only Self-Paced Training courses that have followed this guidance, as well as DOH professional growth criteria, will be eligible for approval for Waterworks operators in Washington.</p>
